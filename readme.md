# repo-man

A console application that generates diagrams helping users to visualize the codebase

## TODO

=> implement IFileColorMapper

- test the composition of the SvgDiagramRenderer now that we know where we're going with this
- add infrastructure class to write data to file (thin wrapper)
- define SvgComposer or use SvgDiagramRenderer as composer and add an SvgBookendManager
- feature: user can specify background color
- feature: implement ignored file extensions for binary file types (png, jpg, bmp, etc.)

## NOTES

- Rather than trying to capture every single file extension, let's only include the file extensions we're concerned about (known code file extensions)
